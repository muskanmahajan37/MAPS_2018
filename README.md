# MAPS_2018

Repository contains data and scripts for my portion of our May 2018 MAPS group (Team 2) presentation on correlation, causality, and cherry picking data. My section discusses (mis)interpreting statistics of the recent "global warming hiatus." 

[MAPS](http://maps-nsf.uci.edu/about.html) is a National Science Foundation (NSF) Research Traineeship (NRT) Program in Machine Learning and Physical Sciences at the University of California, Irvine from 2016-2021 [(NSF NRT-1633631)](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1633631). 

###### Under construction... ```[Python 3.6]```

## Description
+ ```Data/```: Additional data files not provided by Python URL functions
+ ```Figures/```: Arbitrary figures as examples from listed scripts
+ ```Scripts/```: Main [Python](https://www.python.org/) scripts/functions used in data analysis and plotting
+ ```requirements.txt```: List of environments and modules associated with the most recent version of this project. A Python [Anaconda3 Distribution](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/) was used for the analysis. [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) is used for most of the animations (GIF). All code has been tested with Python ```3.6```.
